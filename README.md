## REST API Tutorials

To run this code, you'll first need to use the green __Clone or download__ button on the [Tutorials page](https://github.com/MistyCommunity/Tutorials) to copy the files onto your desktop. This will also ensure that you have the **Tools** directory in the same folder as the code samples, which is required for much of this code to run. Then, open up the `.html` file in a browser window. To see debug messages and other information about the commands Misty is running, open the dev console in your browser window.

**Note:** Before you can run these samples, you must update the `.html` files with your robot's IP address.
