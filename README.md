# Tutorials
This repository includes the full code samples for the tutorials hosted in the Misty Robotics [developer documentation](https://docs.mistyrobotics.com). 

To run this code, you'll first need to use the green __Clone or download__ button on the [Tutorials page](https://github.com/MistyCommunity/Tutorials) to copy the files onto your desktop. This will also ensure that you have the **Tools** directory in the same folder as the code samples, which is needed for them to run. Then, just open up the `.html` file for any code sample. It should open into a browser window. 

These samples require you to manually input your robot's IP address in the `.html` file. For a better view into the commands being sent to your robot, open the JavaScript console for the browser window.
